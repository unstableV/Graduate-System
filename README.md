According to the recent survey more the 10k students used to enroll in European colleges. Students have huge difficulty in identifying the best college catered to their needs and, some may even end up with colleges which are not suitable for them . There is also a chance that they can miss out best colleges. Getting counselors to guide the process is  costlier and even after paying huge amount , still there is an issue of  Most of the students don't know which college is the best for them so they end up getting very less quality of college as compared to their profile. Many students used to take the help of a counselor and pay them a high amount of money and many times instead of giving a large amount of money many frauds will happen. So we are trying to propose a model which will help students to get the best college without paying any amount of money.Analyzing the different parameters and give students the best efficient results.
The proposed model will use logistic regression to find whether the student can get admission into particular group of universities.
Important  features which promote admission into universities are identified using data analysis tools and only the features which impact the outcome are considered for building the model.
